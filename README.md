# Affinity Ruby SDK

Server-side client for the Affinity API. Requires Ruby 3.0+.

Version 0.3.0 targets the deployed Affinity API contract used by TypeScript SDK 1.16.0. Install this SDK from GitHub; registry publication is deferred.

## Install from source

```sh
git clone --branch v0.3.0 https://github.com/affinity-health/affinity-ruby.git
cd affinity-ruby
gem build Affinity.gemspec
gem install ./affinity-health-sdk-0.2.0.gem
```

## Use

Set `AFFINITY_API_KEY` to a Test practice key on your server. Keep API keys out of browser and mobile code.

```ruby
require "affinity"

api = Affinity::Client.new(ENV.fetch("AFFINITY_API_KEY"))
patients = api.patients.list({ limit: 20 })
```



Practice keys identify their practice automatically. Platform keys pass a practice ID in request options or use a scoped client.

See the [SDK guide](docs/guide.md) for platform requests, patient updates, signing, submission, pagination, and errors.
Routine patient writes generate an idempotency key. Persist your own keys for order creation, signing, and submission.

Defaults: API `2026-09-28`, a 60-second timeout, and no automatic retries.

## Verify

```sh
./scripts/check.sh
```

The tests use synthetic fixtures on loopback. The fixture runner requires Python 3; Docker runs the language toolchain for the `scripts/check.sh` commands.

Generated with Cloudflare Forge, Fern, and Affinity's facade generator. [generation.json](generation.json) records the pinned inputs. Fix the generator in the Affinity monorepo before regenerating client code.
